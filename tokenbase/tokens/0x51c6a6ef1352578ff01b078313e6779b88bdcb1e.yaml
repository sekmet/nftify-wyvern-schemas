  DMINT is Distributed MINeable Token working on the Ethereum platform. To mine
  bitcoin you need to spend electricity. To mine DMINT you need to spend some gas.
  The basic principle: the more you have, the more you will get. DMINT can be
  added to any Ethereum Wallet because it is standard ERC20 token.
